6-button-nav
============

On wide screens its 6 tab-like menus, on smaller screens its a key-pad like 2 rows of 3 buttons.

It doesn't scale with odd numbers. So 7 menu items won't really do much for you. But it does scale to some extent with 
even numbers with a few tweaks of the HTML and CSS. 

I mainly wanted to demonstrate how a horizontal menu of tabs can go from 1 row to two rows with a little effort 
in the CSS department.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Enjoy!
